This is the python implementation to Alex Djalali's set-theoretic solution for
the ranking problem in Partial Order Optimality Theory, which can be stated as
follows: Allowing for free variation, given a finite set of input/output pairs,
i.e., a dataset, that a speaker knows to be part of some language, how does one
learn the set of all grammars under some constraint set compatible with that
dataset?

Because Partial Order Optimality Theory is a generalization of Classical
Optimality Theory, this solution also works for all cases in Classical OT.
